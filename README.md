 
 # Phone Number Range Finder By Provider
 
 ## Overview
 This Go project is designed to process a CSV file containing phone numbers and their associated providers. It identifies ranges of consecutive phone numbers for each provider and outputs the results into a new CSV file. The output includes the start and end of each range, the provider's name, and the length of the range.
 
 ## Features
 - Reads phone numbers and providers from a CSV file.
 - Identifies consecutive number ranges for each provider.
 - Outputs the ranges to a new CSV file with range details.
 - Handles large datasets efficiently.
 
 ## Requirements
 - Go (version 1.15 or later) if you want to run the program from source.
